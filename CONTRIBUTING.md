# Contributing to this repository

Thank you for being interested in contributing to this repository! Whether you're a part of Making Sense or not, you rule for helping us build quality guidelines.

Here are a few guidelines for the contributions:

- **Prefer pull requests over issues:** If you have a proposal and it's not too much work, feel free to open a pull request. It's always easier to discuss over a set of changes than on the idea of those changes. Sometimes that is not quite feasible and that's ok too -- but if you have something to show, it's always better to show the real stuff.
- **Make sure you get the approval from the right people:** If you don't have a general consensus, or if nobody has looked at your changes, contact the following people that will help with the right technologies. Tag them in the PRs / issues so that you can get an answer whenever possible.
    - JavaScript ES5: [@AlphaGit][user_alphagit], [@MRavinale][user_mravinale], [@NoeliaSFranco][user_noeliasfranco]
    - JavaScript ES6: [@AlphaGit][user_alphagit], [@MRavinale][user_mravinale], [@NoeliaSFranco][user_noeliasfranco]
    - Angular 1.x: [@AlphaGit][user_alphagit], [@MRavinale][user_mravinale], [@NoeliaSFranco][user_noeliasfranco]
    - NodeJs: [@AlphaGit][user_alphagit], [@MRavinale][user_mravinale], [@NoeliaSFranco][user_noeliasfranco]
    - React: [@JuampiCK][user_juampick], [@KiliSoria][user_kilisoria], [@NoeliaSFranco][user_noeliasfranco]
